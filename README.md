# üìà Stock Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project is a machine learning pipeline to predict the **next-day closing price of Apple (AAPL)** stock using technical indicators and historical price data. The goal is to evaluate how well a linear regression model can forecast price movements, and to experiment with alternative models for better accuracy.
